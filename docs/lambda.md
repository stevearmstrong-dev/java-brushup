By a lambda expression (or just "a lambda"), we mean a function that isn't bound to its name (an anonymous function) but can be assigned to a variable.

The most general form of a lambda expression looks like this: (parameters) -> { body };. Here, the part before -> is the list of parameters (like in methods), and the part after that is the body that can return a value. The brackets { } are required only for multi-line lambda expressions.

Sometimes, lambdas don't have parameters or return values or even both. Even if a lambda doesn't have a value to return, it has a body that does some useful actions (e.g. prints or saves something).

Another important thing â€” like a regular Java object, a lambda expression always has a special type. There are a lot of types presented in the Java Standard Library, two of them are: Function and BiFunction. Both of the classes are located in the java.util.function package among others.

Although Java provides a lot of ways to write lambda expressions, you always need to choose the shortest and most readable way to do this.

Once a lambda expression is created, it can be used in other places of your program like a regular Java object. You can invoke the body of an expression using special methods like apply as many times as you need. The name of the method depends on the type of lambda expression.
```java
boolean result4Div2 = isDivisible.apply(4, 2); // true
boolean result3Div5 = isDivisible.apply(3, 5); // false
```

So, we can invoke a lambda expression like a regular method passing arguments and obtaining results!
